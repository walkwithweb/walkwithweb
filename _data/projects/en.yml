  brief: "The project removed traffic noise and created a new pedestrian walkway / seating area in a space where previously there was only a road.<br><br> It also created a new neighborhood space of meeting, often used by residents and visitors alike, who appreciate the greenery, increased sense of safety due to lack of cars, and the ‘quieter’ soundscape where cars are only audible in the distance."
  about: "We collaborated with Ville de Montreal around the pedestrianization of rue Roy, in the heart of the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough. To create the Terrasses Roy, a section of the street was closed off to traffic and a temporary design was installed by design firm Castor et Pollux in the summer 2017. Four sections were created to invite visitors to relax and interact, including colourful street furniture, communal gardens, and a play area. This pilot project was very well received by the community and extended into the fall and winter of 2017. The space is currently being converted into a permanent outdoor meeting space around urban agriculture."

  participation: "We participated in public consultations and conducted acoustic measurements and audio recordings before and after the pedestrianization. We also administered questionnaires to passers-by to evaluate their experience in the new pedestrian walkway, with an emphasis on soundscape and sonic expectations. We then provided recommendations to the borough on how to reinforce the purpose of this new space through sound. "

  brief: "Noise is a major pollutant of our time but its regulation in policies is often reactive, rarely harmonized across provinces, states or countries, and remains siloed. <br><br> Our project offers recommendations toward an integrated, pro-active approach to environmental noise management"
  about: "Noise policies differ around the world and even within the same country, with various provinces or municipalities within the same province taking different approaches to noise management. In Quebec, noise policies focus on reactive strategies that focus on specific sound sources and their levels (and on reducing them) that distribute responsibilities at different levels of governance.<br><br>Since 2018, Sounds in the City has been working on a review on environmental noise management. The first part of the project, in collaboration with École de Technologie Supérieure, included a systematic review of noise policies around the world to identify best practices in terms of noise limit values, measurement protocols, and communications strategies, as well as a review of how low-level government (municipalities), address noise considerations in Quebec. The second part of the project, in collaboration with Université Laval, focused on how to best integrate sound considerations in urban design and practice, through Quebec and international case studies and interview with professionals of the built environments."
  participation: "The diversity of noise levels included in policies, the varied (or lacking) protocols for measuring those levels as well as the often-siloed approach focusing on specific sources (like car traffic, recreational activities, or industry) addressed at different governmental levels makes environmental noise management a global challenge and limits the transferability of certain documented good practices. We formulated recommendations for our governmental partners on strategies for integrating sound in earlier stages of, for example, planning and design and for managing noise that are not exclusively reliant on noise levels, but rather focus on communication and education."

  brief: "During the hot summer months, a water feature in a pocket park is attractive. But if it’s poorly designed, that water feature is just as likely to dissuade users from making use of the space."
  about: "We conducted a summer-long study on a new public space the city was piloting – the Fleurs de Macadam pocket park, where three prototype designs, each featuring a misting water feature somewhere in the space, were tested. We wanted to see the effects of water features with varying degrees of audibility on how the park users evaluated their soundscapes and the lessons that could be learnt moving forward.<br><br>Through on-site surveys, we found that, on its own, a misting water feature is not a guarantee for an improved soundscape. While two of the designs were evaluated as less chaotic and less loud when the misters were on, the third design was the opposite, likely due to the way the misters were integrated in their designs: the misters for design 3 were located right in the gravel pathways, which often left a muddy, unusable space. <b>Lesson #1: Like all other aspects of design, the design of the sound experience must be considered purposefully</b>."
  participation: "Survey respondents who said they heard water sounds consistently rated them as pleasant. The sound from the misters recalled memories and experiences in the minds of the users of the space, like the cooling feeling of water on a hot summer day. Those recollections influenced the soundscape evaluations in a positive way. <b>Lesson #2: consider the meanings the sound might evoke</b>.<br><br>The truly surprising finding was that even when it was unlikely that respondents could hear the misters, their evaluations on how chaotic or loud the soundscape decreased compared to when the misters were not on. <b>Lesson #3: misters don’t need to be audible to affect how the users of a public space evaluate the way it sounds.</b>"

  about: "Soundscape planning is still an uncommon approach, as are tools that facilitate such proactive planning. In the summer of 2019, we held a futures workshop with urban professionals (including planners and designers) to help determine what technologies we could help add to their city planning toolbox."
  participation: "In the workshop, we introduced basic principles of the soundscape approach, as well as different technologies that could help with future soundscape planning, through three main activities:<br><br>1) an ‘immersive playground’: experimenting with technologies like VR sets with soundscapes (HTC Vive Pro, Oculus Go, and smartphone-based VR sets) and other laptop simulations<br><br>2) a participatory soundscape design session in the state-of-the-art multimedia room at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) <br><br>3) focus groups discussing current challenges of professionals and potential needs, if they were to begin to engage with soundscape designs on their own. <br><br>We integrated these results of the activities into the designs for a prototype virtual reality tool. Development is underway and scheduled for trials in the upcoming months."

  about: 'Sounds in the City has been exploring questions of translation of soundscape scales, given the unique bilingual context offered by Montreal. We have been looking at the vocabulary used by French and English speakers to describe everyday sounds and soundscapes as well as similarities and differences between them; for example, the distinction between “sound” and “noise” differs between French and English.

  brief: "The visual is dominant in urban planning so we develop new tools to help planners understand also the sonic consequences of their planning choices<br><br>Simulating the sound environment in 3D immerses planners in the urban experience they are creating"
  about: 'Each urban development project raises aesthetic, functional, and socio-demographic questions depending on the local context. However, its sounds are considered in the later stages of design or simply remain an afterthought. To raise the awareness of urban professionals to the question of sound in their projects, and to facilitate the processes of consultation, creation, and communication, our team developed an interactive immersive "co-design sound sketchpad". <br><br>This soundscape simulator can help not only play on-site recordings back in a listening room, but also add, position, and move single sources in space. This software allows to simply and efficiently (re)produce the sound environments of various spaces that do not yet exist.'
  participation: "A first public prototype of this tool was unveiled at a CIRMMT-hosted day-long event offered by the “Sounds in the City” team in July 2019. The event was articulated around the integration of new technologies and approaches in the process of co-designing the soundscapes of public spaces. In a concert hall equipped with 48 loudspeakers, an audience of mostly urban professionals used the simulator to discuss about, design and listen to what the soundscape of a specific public space could sound like under different circumstances, while taking into account location constraints: What would be the impact of slowing down traffic on the main avenue? Would it be pertinent to install a fountain in the centre of the square? The simulator allowed participants to listen to a sonic rendering of their suggestions in real-time and appreciate the consequences of planning decisions on the sound environment."

  brief: "Montreal had a short-lasting 6dB reduction in sound levels in the downtown, which returned mostly to normal with the restarting of construction and traffic<br><br>The periods of restrictions, lockdowns, and other measures following the onset of COVID-19 led to residents forming new associations and habits with home and public space use, driven partially by the drastic changes in their sound environments"
  about: "Sounds in the City engaged in a multi-method, multi-year study observing the COVID-19 auditory experience, including:
    <br><br>
    • Interviews (2020 and 2021)<br>
    • Diary study<br>
    • Questionnaires<br>
    • Sound level measurements<br>

    <br><br>"
  participation: "The findings of the first year of the pandemic showed us a very temporary 6 dB drop in overall sound levels during the first restriction. Sound levels largely returned to normal with the return of construction and traffic, yet public life suffered, and people were very conscious of the sounds that they missed. Public space use was transformed in many ways and saw many new uses while those who were working at home had to contend with new sound environments and new challenges during their workdays. This change was especially hard on families with children"

  brief: "Our experience of urban environments is shaped by many factors, from expectations to personality to the specifics of the situation<br><br>The model of contextual influences we have started to build is a first step towards helping urban planners and policy makers create more inclusive urban spaces"
  about: "We all know that context matters: where and who we are matter just as much as what we are doing in any given moment of life. In a series of studies, including modeling of on-site factors and various laboratory experiments, Sounds in the City has investigated the many ways in which context matters, particularly for soundscape evaluations.<br><br>In laboratory experiments, we showed that what we call ‘situational factors’ like location, day, and time of use shape our perceptions of the sound environment regardless of expectations we might have had before using a space. For example, a quieter location is evaluated as more pleasant and less eventful than a noisier location or afternoons are generally evaluated as less calm and more eventful than evenings, while weekends are more eventful than weekdays."
  participation: "Meanwhile, on-site studies hinted at other factors that are not directly related to sound levels, such as social interaction – that is, if a person is alone or with others – and ‘personal factors’ like extraversion, gender, age, and noise sensitivity. People in groups find their soundscape more pleasant and less eventful than solitary users, potentially because they are focusing their attention on the other(s) they are with. And women and younger people find their soundscape more pleasant and less eventful, which can be linked to the fact that they go out in groups more than men and older people, respectively. More extraverted people evaluate their soundscape as less eventful and people who are more sensitive to noise (like women and older people) tend to evaluate their soundscape as less pleasant.<br><br>While we are only beginning to scratch the surface of the complexity of factors that influence how we evaluate soundscapes, it is essential to keep in mind that context matters and that designing spaces must take into account this myriad of experiences."

  brief: "How can we research and design a lively and inclusive sound environment?"
  about: "The EU-funded SONINURB project studies the sound environment that contributes to the  atmosphere unique to each location, understanding how atmosphere directly impacts the perceived quality of the urban environment:  it can either attract people or drive them away or make them feel comfortable or under threat. The project aims to show how researching the sound  environment can support novel approaches to urban policy analysis and policy design. It further explores how experimenting with new sound planning tools to investigate urban areas undergoing transformation can lead to collaborative approaches to urban sound design. Finally, the project shows how the use of participatory sound installations and sonic interventions can promote social inclusion and sustainable local development."
  participation: "The project addresses these aims by fieldwork in two different geographical locations: Montreal (Canada) – as part of Sounds in the City, and Venice (Italy) – as part of Iuav University of Venice."

  brief: "The sound of recreational activities is a contentious topic for ideas on urban sonic cohabitations<br><br>The sound of recreational activities is “expected” when living downtown and nightlife is not the main issue of residents, but construction noise and other punctual noise issues"
  about: "The sound of recreational activities is often considered a necessary nuisance of urban economy to be mitigated and while urban life must respond to the needs and expectations of both residents and visitors, its sounds sit at the intersection of concerns on liveability of and vitality and challenges ideas on successful sonic cohabitation. "
  participation: "Sounds in the City collaborated with the City of Montreal and Montreal’s public health department (DRSP) to develop ÉcoutezMTL / ListenUpMTL - a mixed methods study aimed at better understanding the complexity of living in the vicinity of vibrant urban neighborhoods, focusing on two pedestrianized streets and the entertainment district (Quartier des Spectacles) in downtown Montreal. Using sound level measurements, surveys, resident diaries and interviews, we aimed to complement the existing limited, negative portrayal of recreational noise and nightlife in the media, public imagination, and in policy. Our research shows that the sounds from recreational activities (including festivals and events as well as everyday street life) are not always perceived negatively by residents, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of sonic cohabitation lie elsewhere.

  participation: "Residents and workers in the area had a lengthy, readily available list of suggestions on how to make the area more livable. These cover not only technical solutions, but also urban planning and design, communication and community building or governance. These solutions sometimes offer innovative, place-based solutions that demonstrate the crucial nature of the input of locals when both documenting and seeking to transform an area.<br><br>The Sounds in the City team is now collaborating with both the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough and the Montreal Port authority to implement solutions to sonic cohabitation issues between the industrial and residential uses in the area."

  brief: "Nightlife activities contribute to the vitality and attractiveness of cities but can also generate conflicts around unwanted noise<br><br>We will offer recommendations on Montreal’s development of a nightlife policy that integrates a sonic dimension"
  about: "Many worldwide cities face the challenge of striking a balance between livability and vitality, and this dichotomy is often tested in the sonic dimension. However, no world cities, including Montreal, have expressed a nightlife policy that tackles these challenges head-on."
  participation: "Sounds in the City started a collaboration with the City of Montreal and Montreal’s public health department (DRSP) to investigate and integrate the needs and expectations of different stakeholders for the development of a new nightlife strategy using the soundscape approach document. The project documents situations of sound conflicts and cohabitation in Montreal to better understand/characterize the dynamics at play & issue recommendations to improve public policies from an economic development perspective where the human being is at the center. The first step was a comprehensive review of relevant academic literature as well as public and private reports provided by partners on the status of sound-related knowledge centered on Montreal. The second step was the development of pilot projects: the ListenUpMTL pilot project and the Assomption Sud–Longue-Pointe project.<br><br>This project is a unique opportunity to involve multiple stakeholders around night noise and integrate sound consideration in the new Montreal nightlife policy that is under development."

  brief: "Montreal’s entertainment district (the Quartier des Spectacles) is facing unique challenges balancing vitality and livability due to the multitude of events and festivals it hosts throughout the year. Sounds of festivals are not a primary source of annoyance, but rather the sounds of nightlife (pre-COVID-19). Older residents enjoy and take parts in the festivals and events, questioning ideas of retirement and aging in the city."
  about: "The Quartier des Spectacles (QDS) is a dense multi-cultural hub for music, art, design, and food, with a diverse population and a flair for public events (including large-scale festivals), while also housing a residential population of mixed socio-economic backgrounds, ever-growing due to new high-rise development projects. It has a need to balance its reputation for vitality with its interest in maintaining a livable environment for its current and potential residents. <br><br> Sounds in the City partnered with the Quartier des Spectacles Partnership (the organization responsible for managing the QDS entertainment district) to conduct on-site research aiming to better grasp the expectations of the various stakeholders (residents, festivalgoers, festival promoters) and to identify useful guidelines for defining the potential future sound management plan active in the area. We found that, pre-COVID-19, sounds of festivals were not a primary source of annoyance, but rather an inspiration for residents to engage with their spaces and their neighborhood. Interestingly, older residents chose to move to QDS because of its accessibility but also due to the festivals and events, raising questions on ideas on who the festivals and events are for."

  brief: "A sound installation will be deployed in a Parisian public space to create an appeasing and varied soundscape. A research-creation collaboration seeks to inform the composition of the sound installation by testing different prototypes through soundscape simulations based on in-situ recordings."
  about: "While recent studies in soundscape suggest that sound art installations can have a positive influence on public space evaluations, there is no scientific method to date to inform sound art composition in public space. Hosted partially in Paris, at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), the project is a research-creation collaboration around the permanent integration of a sound installation in the forecourt of Paris’ Judicial Courthouse: Nadine Schütz’s Niches Acoustiques. The sound installation’s goal is to create an appeasing and varied auditory foreground and to better connect the public space to its surrounding. In the first phase of the project, we are conducting a series of listening tests involving High-Order Ambisonic soundscape simulations of prototypes relying on different composition strategies, to inform the sound artist’s composition of the sound installation with space users’ feedback.<br><br> We are developing a method that can support the design of a site-specific, permanent sound art installation. This research-creation project entails an in-depth collaboration between researchers and artists towards a better integration of the sound installation to its surroundings. The provided soundscape simulations are beneficial to the composition process, as they allow the artist to have a realistic model of the resulting sound environment. The controlled listening tests will yield critical information to the composer in linking compositional parameters with their effect on soundscape perception."

  brief: "A sound installation was deployed to highlight the cultural heritage of a small public space in Montreal. A research-creation collaboration seeks to inform the composition of the sound installation, including field recordings and soundscape simulations to in-situ surveys."
  about: "This research-creation collaboration is about the design and evaluation of the permanent public space sound installation Les Madelinéennes by Charles Montambault, deployed since 2023 in a pocket park (Parc-des-Madelinots) in the Montreal borough of Verdun. Verdun was a major emigration destination from the Magdalen Islands (Îles-de-la-Madeleine) and now has the largest community of Madelinots outside of the islands. The Parc-des-Madelinots is a small public space honoring the Madelinots diaspora. However, it is exposed to high levels of traffic noise, sparsely used by residents, and mostly perceived as a transit space. The goal of Les Madelinéennes is to provide a more soothing and pleasant sound environment to this public space while highlighting the community’s cultural heritage through compositions using field recordings from the Magdalen Islands.<br><br> This research project builds on the methods developed as per the collaboration surrounding the Niches Acoustiques installation. It involves field recordings and laboratory evaluations of prototypes of the sound installation with residents familiar to the space. Specifically, we investigate how the dominance of different coastal sound sources (e.g. birds, water, wind) can affect the public space’s soundscape. Design recommendations will be made from the results of the study to inform the composition of a new iteration of the sound installation."

  brief: "Church buildings have particular sensory qualities, especially sonic qualities, which may bring positive outcomes even in the context of secularization. The research project explores the restorative potential of church buildings and how they could be used as “quiet places” in the city."
  about: "While church attendance has drastically decreased during the past decades, especially in Northern Europe and North America, the preservation of religious buildings has become a pressing question, as secularization has left many church buildings vacant or underused. In Montreal only, the Québec council of religious heritage reported that 22% of the places of worship across denominations listed in its inventory dating from 2003 have been demolished, closed or converted to other uses.<br><br> The project investigates the role the specific sensory qualities of churches could play with regards to today’s more secular sensibilities. As a very different environment from everyday life, the ambiance of churches can foster a singular mode of attention and sensing. In terms of acoustics, the long reverberation times and the relative isolation from exterior city noise can lead to restorative benefits, like stress reduction.<br><br> We conducted soundwalks and interviews in five churches of the Centre Sud and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montréal, with participants from these neighbourhoods. Preliminary results show that churches are perceived as places “out of time and out of space”, which is in line with previous investigations of church ambiances and further highlights the role that sound plays in shaping the experiences."

  brief: "A semi-permanent speaker system (Musikiosk) was installed in the gazebo of a public park (Parc du Portugal) and users could connect and play whatever content they wanted. Musikiosk increased the perceived pleasantness of the soundscape of the park and improved moods for park visitors, whether or not they were directly engaging with Musikiosk. Musikiosk added a new layer of activity into the park without displacing existing users."
  about: "In 2015, researchers from McGill University and ÉTS worked together with the Plateau Mont-Royal borough to install Musikiosk in the gazebo of Parc du Portugal, a small public park in Montreal. Musikiosk was a speaker system through which park users, with the help of an audio jack, could connect their personal devices to a small array of freely provided speakers installed in the gazebo and thus to share their own music with others.<br><br> Documenting their experiences through interviews and surveys, Musikiosk users expressed excitement in engaging with an urban park in novel ways by taking over their space acoustically and offering them an unconventional opportunity to interact with other park users. Through community outreach efforts and extensive planning, the Musikiosk team minimized the displacement of existing park users and managed the expectations and annoyance of neighbors.<br><br> This study kickstarted a long series of projects in collaboration with Montreal city officials and other stakeholders."

  brief: "The project experimented with a novel interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, sound artists, and the City. The presence of sound installations enhances the experience of the public space and reinforces spatial design goals."
  about: "The Plateau-Mont-Royal borough took a different approach to determining how a new public space – Fleurs-de-Macadam – could look and sound. In a first stage, over the course of the summer of 2018, the borough installed 3 separate prototype designs and allowed the public to evaluate each site. Partners from the Audiotopie artist collective developed and deployed 3 sound installations in these temporary designs. Sounds in the City evaluated the resulting soundscapes and helped the borough shape the future space for users, as well as inform the composition of a fourth sound installation, deployed in the summer of 2019.<br><br> Through an iterative process of design, deployment and evaluation, we documented the impact of the different sound installations over two years in a new public square. Using questionnaires with passers-by and sound level measurements, we identified patterns of use and main activities conducted in the square. These results informed the compositional process of sound installations that “resonate” with the desired ambiances throughout the day. The analysis of questionnaires indicated that the experiences of public space users were enhanced in the presence of all four sound installations, with positive effects on the perceived pleasantness, calmness, and ability to take a break. These results highlight the potential of intentional sound design in a public space context as well as the specific role of research creation collaborations to shape urban soundscapes."

  brief: "Immersive strategies like soundwalks encourage sound awareness and show how many distinct and diverse environments there are in the city. Soundwalks can take many forms and can be excellent educational tools for professionals and the broader community alike."
  about: "A soundwalk is, as the name implies, a walk destined to help you listen to and reflect on the soundscapes in which you are embedded. Soundwalks are very site-specific and can take multiple forms: they can be self-guided (think walking around with a map) or guided; they can also be focused on observation (staying quiet while listening) or they can be interactive (for example, clapping in space). Finally, soundwalks can serve a broad array of goals, most of them with an educational component, from teaching children about the sounds of their neighborhoods to highlighting to urban professionals the role of sound in urban planning and design.<br><br> Our own offer of soundwalks is diverse. Our most successful soundwalk, destined for a wide audience of urban practitioners and the public alike, will guide you through a variety of urban soundscapes. We point out some of the urban planning and design strategies that have shaped them as well as sharing some of the research that could contribute to making them respond even better to the needs and expectations of their users. We have offered iterations of this soundwalk with urban professionals in 3 cities (Montreal, Amsterdam, and Boston). If you are in one of these cities and would like to join us for a soundwalk, please contact us. The walks are from 2 to 3 hours but can be given in shorter versions if necessary.<br><br> Also, we are always developing new walks! Do you want to teach children how to be sound aware in fun ways? Or show teenagers how to engage with their sonic spaces using their smart devices? Reach out! We are open to working together to develop new tools that are specific to your needs."

  brief: "Low income and racialized groups are often overexposed to noise in their homes. They may also have less access to outdoor spaces where they can escape from noise."
  about: "The sounds that fill our everyday lives matter for our health and wellbeing. Undesirable sounds, which we refer to as noise, can have negative auditory and non-auditory health effects, as well as reducing our overall quality of life. Spaces with desirable sounds, such as nature or festivals, can reduce stress levels, helping to improve overall health and wellbeing. Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of environmental problems like noise than others because of who they are, including children, people with low income and racialized people. We’re studying the inequalities faced by these groups in two areas: 1) exposure to noise and 2) access to health-promoting sonic environments. In many cities and regions around the world, low-income and racialized groups are often overexposed to noise in their homes. Early evidence suggests that they may have less access to sonic environments that enable them to de-stress."

    - "What are the relationships between having walkable paths to green spaces and residents’ everyday soundscapes?"
    - "Does walkability around green spaces impact residents’ everyday soundscape?"
    - "Is having a more positive sonic environment in the neighborhood promoting the walkability of green spaces?"
  about: "Would you walk on a visually pleasant sidewalk if you were annoyed with the noise of cars passing by? Sounds are an important element of our everyday life; however, they have rarely been studied in the context of walking environments. While the aim of walking in green spaces is to provide a restorative experience for people, the quality of the walking path and its soundscape has not been studied around the parks. This project aims to (1) understand if more walkable areas around green spaces result in a better experience while residents walk to them. To do so, we use maps of the sidewalk width, trees, points of interest, etc. -which are the walkability indicators- on a large scale and will measure walkability in GIS software. We will see if the higher walkability of the neighborhood promotes people’s overall sound experience of their walk to the green space of people living in different neighborhoods in Montreal. Moreover, in the second phase (2) we will focus on people’s everyday experiences on a small scale in their neighborhood. Using participatory mapping, the relationship between the paths residents choose and the sound environment will be studied. This study paves the way to understanding the relationships between walkability and urban soundscapes."
